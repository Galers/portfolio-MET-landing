# Project Description:

<img align="center" src="./Main.png">

This landing page is dedicated to **The Metropolitan Museum of Art**, also known as **THE MET**, and contains basic information about the museum, its exhibitions, opening hours, and contacts.

**The MET** landing page project involves the implementation of a responsive landing page based on _Figma design_. It has _4 sections_ and _a burger menu_. The implementation was carried out using the _BEM_ (Block Element Modifier) methodology and _SCSS_ for styling. The page was _adapted_ to different screen sizes, which ensured an optimal user experience on all devices.
