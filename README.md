## Project Description:

<div align="center">
  <img  src="./Main.png">
</div>

This landing page is dedicated to **The Metropolitan Museum of Art**, also known as **THE MET**, and contains basic information about the museum, its exhibitions, opening hours, and contacts.

**The MET** landing page project involves the implementation of a responsive landing page based on [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/lSR1m42L9YwzQwzzxKwHpw/THE-MET?node-id=8590-29&t=I1YuOfVDcN7zNczN-0). It has _4 sections_ and _a burger menu_. The implementation was carried out using the _BEM_ (Block Element Modifier) methodology and _SCSS_ for styling. The page was _adapted_ to different screen sizes, which ensured an optimal user experience on all devices.

## Technologies:

1. HTML5:

   - The entire site is written in HTML5. Using _BEM_ (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

2. JS:
   The following functions were implemented using JS:
   - Disabled form submission;
   - Activation of the Pop-up menu (burger-menu);
   - When the burger menu is activated, the scroll disappears;
   - Closing the menu by clicking on link.
   - Click on the phone icon, a pop-up menu opens:

3. CSS
4. SCSS
   - The styling of the entire page is handled using the SCSS preprocessor, allowing for more modular and maintainable CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
